# Investigate a Relational Database  

SQL code was written to run the SQL queries and to answer interesting questions about the database. As part of the project submission, output was generated to present the output.

In this project,the Sakila DVD Rental database was invesstigated. The Sakila Database holds information about a company that rents movie DVDs. For this project, the database is queried to gain an understanding of the customer base, such as what the patterns in movie watching are across different customer groups, how they compare on payment earnings, and how the stores compare in their performance.

The project includes the following:
- A set of slides with a question, visualization, and small summary on each slide.
- A text file with all the queries that are needed to answer each of the four questions.
